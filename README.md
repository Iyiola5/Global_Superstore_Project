Data cleaning and importation into PowerBI workbench.
In the course of trying to clean the data using Excel, I realised it was already a clean data when collected from the source. I checked for data duplicates and spelling errors and found nothing. I went ahead to standardize the Excel spreadsheet, seperate the Orders, Returns and People sheets and covert them into CSV formats for easy data importation into PowerBI where i transformed the data and then apply.
